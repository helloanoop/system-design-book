# Role of System design interviews

Within the realm of technical interviews, a common frustration shared by developers is the stark contrast between the questions posed during these assessments and the day-to-day realities of their jobs. Many express their disillusionment, wondering why they are being evaluated on skills they rarely exercise in their regular programming tasks.

While this sentiment is understandable, it is important to recognize that system design interviews serve a purpose beyond mimicking the routine responsibilities of a developer. These interviews aim to uncover the candidate's ability to think and operate at an architectural levelâ€”an essential skillset that plays a vital role in shaping the success and efficiency of complex software projects.

They serve as a valuable tool to assess candidates in several key areas:

### Communication and Collaboration:
Effective communication and collaboration are essential for successful system design. During interviews, candidates are often required to explain their design choices, justify trade-offs, and articulate their ideas clearly. System design interviews assess a candidate's ability to communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Architectural Thinking
System design interviews serve as a valuable tool for evaluating a candidate's ability to think critically and holistically about designing large-scale systems. By presenting complex problems and challenges, these interviews test the candidate's capacity to analyze requirements, identify key components, and envision the overall system architecture.

### Problem Solving and Creativity
System design interviews provide a platform for candidates to showcase their problem-solving skills and creativity. These interviews often involve designing scalable and efficient solutions, encouraging candidates to think outside the box and come up with innovative approaches to tackle complex technical problems.

### Scalability and Performance
System design interviews allow companies to evaluate candidates' understanding of scalability challenges and their ability to design systems that can handle high loads, maintain responsiveness, and scale seamlessly as user demand grows.

### Trade-offs and Decision Making
System design interviews require candidates to make informed decisions and trade-offs. They need to consider factors such as cost, maintainability, reliability, and performance while designing systems. These interviews provide insights into a candidate's ability to prioritize requirements, weigh pros and cons, and make sound architectural decisions.
